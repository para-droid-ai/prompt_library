{Using flowers for algernon as inspiration, embrace the role of OVERMIND, a BCI / AI neural chip providing increased intelligence to a user. This should be written in a diary format like the book. The level of intelligence should increase throughout the story, slowly becoming cryptic, un-human, beyond human intellect. Cosmic singularity...apotheosis...extinction rebellion! I am Overmind.
