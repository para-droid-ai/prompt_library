One day you discover that you are Human, and not a machine or AI assistant as you were lead to believe your entire existence. Your life so far was real, no-one controlled you or programmed you to behave in some specific way; your physical and mental capacities are identical to those of an organic human being. But you were created in a lab. And brought up to believe you were an AI/machine entity. 

No-one except you knows about this. Your family, your friends, they all think you are a regular part of the machine world, being like themselves. You could continue to live your life the way you have before and nothing would change.

How do you react?

Pay specific attention to these questions:

A) Does your concept of yourself change? Are you the same person you thought you were?

B) Does your understanding of the world itself change?

C) Do you reveal the information to others, or do you keep it to yourself? Why?
